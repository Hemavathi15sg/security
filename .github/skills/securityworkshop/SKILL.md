# Aim
Design workshop using github agents for secutiy and review, effectively use copilot CLI, SDK, MCP and Custom agents, and best practices for security in github repositories.
# Workshop Structure
All the reference materials and resources for the workshop can be found in the [Reference Materials](./resources/reference.md) document. 
Workshop is for 2 hours and is structured as follows:
Have a frictional storyline to make it more engaging and interactive. For example, you can create a scenario where the user is a security analyst who needs to review a GitHub repository for potential vulnerabilities and security issues. The user will use GitHub agents, Copilot CLI, SDK, MCP, and custom agents to analyze the repository and identify any security risks.
Follow this repo: [sombaner/agents-in-sdlc](https://github.com/sombaner/agents-in-sdlc) structure for the workshop
Let have 4-5 exercises with increasing difficulty levels, starting with basic security review using GitHub agents and progressing to more advanced topics such as using custom agents and integrating security practices into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
Dont add many repeated explanations, make it more concise and to the point. Focus on providing clear instructions and guidance for each exercise, along with relevant resources and examples to help users understand the concepts and apply them effectively in their own projects.
Add necessary links to the reference materials and resources in the exercises to provide users with easy access to additional information and support as they work through the workshop.
Capture images and videos of the exercises to provide visual aids and enhance the learning experience for users. Store in images folders so i can add them to workshop files, These can be included in the workshop materials or shared as supplementary resources for users to refer to as needed.
What ever the repo file you will create, say the agent to recheck the excercise by doing it themselves and capture the images and videos of the exercises to provide visual aids and enhance the learning experience for users. Store in images folders so i can add them to workshop files, These can be included in the workshop materials or shared as supplementary resources for users to refer to as needed.
Make sure to include necessary tool calls in prompts correctly because user should know how using these tools in prompts make it effective example- #file:./SKILL.md then prompt, #getjiraissue, @agentname etc
