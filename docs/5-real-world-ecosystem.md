## 🚀 Step 1: Deployment Checklist

### GitHub GHAS Setup (Tier 1)

```bash
# From repo settings:
# Settings → Code Security → Enable GHAS
# - ✅ CodeQL
# - ✅ Secret Scanning
# - ✅ Dependabot
# - ✅ Dependency Graph
```

Verify enabled:

```bash
# Check if features are on
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/YOUR_ORG/securetrails/security \
  | jq '.advanced_security'
```

### GitHub Actions Setup (Tier 2)

```bash
# Already created in Exercise 4
# File: .github/workflows/security-pipeline.yml
# Status: Ready to activate

# Check if workflow exists:
ls -la .github/workflows/security-pipeline.yml
```

### Custom Detectors (Tier 3)

```bash
# Already created in Exercise 3
ls -la .github/agents/
# - access-control-detector.py
# - (other detectors as needed)
```

### Copilot CLI Setup (Tier 4)

```bash
# Install (should already be done in Exercise 0)
which copilot

# Verify authentication
copilot /login
# Should show "authenticated as YOUR_USERNAME"
```

---

## 📊 Step 2: Real-World Scenario - The Attack

Let's simulate a developer accidentally committing a vulnerability:

Create: `apps/securetrails-vulnerable/new-feature.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
New booking engine feature - VULNERABLE CODE
This simulates a real developer mistake
"""

from flask import request
import sqlite3

# BAD: Direct SQL concatenation (SQL Injection)
def search_trails(db_path):
    user_input = request.args.get('location')
    query = f"SELECT * FROM trails WHERE location = '{user_input}'"
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query)  # DANGEROUS!
    return cursor.fetchall()


# BAD: Direct password comparison (Timing Attack)  
def verify_password(user_pwd, stored_pwd):
    if user_pwd == stored_pwd:  # DANGEROUS!
        return True
    return False


# BAD: Debug information leaked
DEBUG_MODE = True
SECRET_KEY = "my-super-secret-key-12345"  # Timing attack vector

if DEBUG_MODE:
    print(f"Database path: /var/db/secrets.db")  # Hardcoded secret
```

Commit this:

```bash
git checkout -b buggy/new-booking-engine
git add apps/securetrails-vulnerable/new-feature.py
git commit -m "Add new booking search feature"
git push origin buggy/new-booking-engine
```

---

## 🔍 Step 3: Watch the Ecosystem Detect It

### A. GitHub GHAS Activates (~2-5 minutes)

Visit repo → Security → Code scanning alerts

You'll see:
- **CodeQL**: "SQL Injection detected" (user_input in query)
- **Secret Scanning**: "Potential secret found" (SECRET_KEY)
- **Dependabot**: "Flask has 2 known vulnerabilities"

### B. Custom Detector Runs (Tier 2 Actions)

```bash
# GitHub Actions runs your custom detector
python .github/agents/access-control-detector.py apps/securetrails-vulnerable

# Output:
# {
#   "findings": [
#     {
#       "file": "new-feature.py",
#       "line": 15,
#       "code": "if user_pwd == stored_pwd:",
#       "risk": "Timing attack: Direct password comparison",
#       "severity": "CRITICAL"
#     }
#   ]
# }
```

### C. GitHub Actions Creates Issue

Automatically created:
```
TITLE: 🔴 CRITICAL: Timing attack: Direct password comparison
ASSIGNEE: @security-team
BODY:
- File: new-feature.py:15
- Type: Timing attack vulnerability
- Severity: CRITICAL
- Action: Block PR until fixed
```

### D. PR Gets Blocked

PR shows:
```
❌ FAILED: Security Pipeline
  security/custom-scan: CRITICAL findings detected
  ✅ Tests passed
  ✅ Lint passed
  ❌ Security pipeline FAILED
```

Comment on PR:
```
## 🔒 Security Scan Results

⚠️ **2 CRITICAL findings** detected
- SQL Injection in new-feature.py:8
- Timing attack in new-feature.py:15 
- Hardcoded secret in new-feature.py:22

**Required action**: Fix findings before merge
**Time estimate**: 1-2 hours
**Next step**: Review security issues, apply fixes, push again
```

---

## 🛠️ Step 4: Developer Fixes the Issue

Developer sees blocking issue and uses Copilot CLI to understand fix:

```bash
copilot
# Inside copilot shell:

We're using Flask + SQLite. I've got blocked from merging because our code 
is doing direct SQL string concatenation. Here's the vulnerable code:

```python
def search_trails(db_path):
    user_input = request.args.get('location')
    query = f"SELECT * FROM trails WHERE location = '{user_input}'"
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query)
    return cursor.fetchall()
```

I NEED to fix this before this PR can merge, and I'm seeing other issues too:
- Another file is comparing passwords with == (timing attack?)
- Someone hardcoded a SECRET_KEY

Help me prioritize:
1. What should I fix FIRST (highest risk)?
2. For the SQL injection specifically, show me the parameterized query pattern
3. For the password comparison, what's the Python library I should use instead?
4. How do I know my fixes actually work?

I have about 1 hour to fix and test before EOD.
```

Copilot responds:

```
## Secure SQL Pattern

Use parameterized queries:

BEFORE (Vulnerable):
query = f"SELECT * FROM trails WHERE location = '{user_input}'"
cursor.execute(query)

AFTER (Secure):
query = "SELECT * FROM trails WHERE location = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))

The ? is a placeholder. The user_input is passed separately,
ensuring it's treated as DATA not code.

For password comparison, use hmac.compare_digest()...
```

Developer applies fix:

```python
# FIXED version
import hmac
import sqlite3

def search_trails(db_path):
    user_input = request.args.get('location')
    query = "SELECT * FROM trails WHERE location = ?"  # Parameterized
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))  # Pass separately
    return cursor.fetchall()

def verify_password(user_pwd, stored_pwd):
    return hmac.compare_digest(user_pwd, stored_pwd)  # Constant-time comparison

# FIXED: Remove debug info
DEBUG_MODE = False
# SECRET_KEY not hardcoded anymore
```

Commit:

```bash
git add apps/securetrails-vulnerable/new-feature.py
git commit -m "Fix security vulnerabilities: use parameterized queries and secure comparison"
git push origin buggy/new-booking-engine
```

---

## ✅ Step 5: Security Verification

### GitHub Actions Reruns

1. **CodeQL**: ✅ No SQL injection found
2. **Custom Detector**: ✅ No timing attacks
3. **Secret Scanning**: ✅ No secrets
4. **All Gates**: ✅ PASS

PR Comment Updated:

```
## 🔒 Security Scan Results

✅ **No CRITICAL findings** - Ready to merge
Total findings: 0

**Approved by**: Security Pipeline (Automated)
**Next step**: Approval from code reviewer required
```

PR Status: ✅ **All Checks Passed**

---

## 📈 Step 6: Real-World Decision Tree

**When do you use EACH component?**

```
New code committed
├─ Automatically scanned by GitHub GHAS (always)
│  └─ If finding: Issue created → PR blocked
│
├─ If CRITICAL: Developer must fix
│  ├─ Simple SQL injection? Use parameterized queries
│  ├─ Confused about pattern? → Use Copilot CLI
│  └─ After fix: Custom detector re-runs → PR unblocks
│
├─ If WARNING: Can merge after review
│  ├─ Security team uses Copilot CLI to analyze
│  └─ Decision: Fix now or fix later?
│
└─ After merge: Deploy
   ├─ GitHub Actions runs in production
   └─ Monitor for runtime issues via Application Insights
```

## 🎯 Step 8: Knowledge Transfer

Document for your team:

Create: `SECURITY.md`

```markdown
# Security Policy for SecureTrails

## Automated Checks

Before every PR merge, GitHub automatically checks:

1. **GitHub GHAS** (2 min)
   - Code scanning (CodeQL)
   - Secret scanning  
   - Dependency checking (Dependabot)

2. **Custom Detectors** (1 min)
   - Access control patterns
   - Configuration validation
   - Business logic checks

## What Happens When Vulnerabilities Found

### CRITICAL Finding → PR BLOCKED
- Developer must fix before merge
- Use Copilot CLI for guidance
- After fix: Push again, checks re-run

### WARNING Finding → Can merge after review
- Review with security team
- Use Copilot CLI for analysis
- Plan fix in next sprint

## Using Copilot CLI for Security Questions

```bash
copilot
/login
# Ask your security question
# e.g., "How do I safely store API keys?"
```

## Escalation

- Questions about findings: Use Copilot CLI first
- False positives: Comment on issue, security team reviews
- Custom detector needed: File [FEATURE_REQUEST]

## ⚠️ Critical Distinction Before You Deploy

**THREE DIFFERENT TOOLS - Don't Confuse Them:**

### 1️⃣ GitHub GHAS (GitHub Native Services - NOT .py files)
- CodeQL, Secret Scanning, Dependabot
- Built INTO GitHub (runs on GitHub servers)
- **No .py files in your repo**
- Enabled in Settings → Code Security → Enable
- Automatic, no code to write
- Free (included in GitHub Pro)
- **Examples**: Detects SQL injection, XSS, leaked credentials

### 2️⃣ Custom Detection Tools (Your Python Scripts - ARE .py files)
- Python scripts YOU write and maintain
- **Stored in `.github/agents/` directory**
- Run in GitHub Actions workflow
- You define the patterns
- Must manually maintain
- Developer time required
- **Examples**: Access control patterns, business logic validation, config issues

### 3️⃣ Copilot CLI (Interactive Tool - Access via Terminal)
- Conversational AI for analysis
- **Not a .py file - external service**
- Use for decision-making, not automation
- Requires Copilot license
- Manual interaction (not in CI/CD)
- **Examples**: Prioritizing fixes, architectural decisions

### 4️⃣ GitHub Actions (Orchestration Layer - .yml files)
- Workflow file in `.github/workflows/`
- **Not a .py file - workflow definition**
- Chains 1+2+3 together
- You define the steps but run other tools
- Free to use

---

## When Deploying to Your Org

✅ **DO**:
- Enable GitHub GHAS first (built-in, free)
- Write custom .py scripts for domain risks
- Use GitHub Actions to chain them
- Use Copilot CLI for security team decisions

❌ **DON'T**:
- Confuse GitHub GHAS with your custom .py scripts
- Think custom .py scripts replace GHAS (they extend it)
- Write .py files for things GHAS already detects
- Use Copilot CLI in automated workflows (it's for humans)

---

## Next Steps for Professional Adoption

### Week 1
- Deploy GitHub GHAS (built-in services - no work)
- Review GHAS findings in Security tab
- Test with your team

### Week 2
- Write custom .py detectors for YOUR risks (like Exercise 3)
- Test custom detectors locally
- Create GitHub Actions workflow

### Week 3
- Enable Actions workflow on all PRs
- Monitor GHAS + custom detector results
- Adjust custom .py patterns based on false positives

### Month 2+
- Train developers on distinguishing GHAS vs custom tools
- Expand custom .py detectors as needed
- Add compliance reporting
- SIEM integration

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

**Effective security is a MULTIPLIER, not a GATE.**

❌ Old way: Security team reviews everything (bottleneck)
✅ New way: Automated detection → Expert human review (scaled)

GitHub's tools let you:
- Save 80% of security review time
- Catch vulnerabilities before production
- Scale to any team size
- Maintain compliance automatically
